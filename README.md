## Puppet automated WordPress deployment framework

This is a framework I have developed to automate the deployment of WordPress websites on my VPS hosting.

With one line of code, I can create a new WordPress website, complete with Apache vhost configuration and all plugins and themes up-to-date.

It requires a standard puppet setup with master and at least one agent, as outlined on the PuppetLabs website at https://puppetlabs.com.
